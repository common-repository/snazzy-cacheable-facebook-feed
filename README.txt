Improve site speed and SEO rankings with the FREE Cacheable Facebook Feed plugin for Wordpress! Quick and easy install.

== Description ==
The fastest and most efficient Facebook plugin available. Display your Facebook feed anywhere on your website simply and easily. This plugin will cache all images on your websites for super-fast loading times. Best of all, this plugin is entirely free!

Our Facebook plugin can be installed and all setup in less than 60 seconds. All you need to do is install it, put in your Facebook ID, then place the shortcode, or assign the widget on your site in the location that you want to display your feed. 

Most Facebook plugins use images hosted on the Facebook server and therefore take a very long time to load, which brings down the entire loading speed of the website. 

= Slow site speed effects: =
*   User experience - slow site speed can cause users to leave the website because they are waiting too long for the site to load.
*   SEO - Google’s algorithm penalizes websites with slow loading speeds. Speeding up your load times helps you rank higher in the search engines. 
*   User trust – Studies show that potential customers have more trust towards a fast loading website. More trust = higher conversion rate. 

Our Facebook plugin solves this problem by caching all media so your site will load faster than ever! 

This plugin also loads all your Facebook content as HTML which can be indexed by Google to help with SEO.

Historically, Facebook feeds have been one of the most damaging Wordpress plugins from a performance perspective. Why?

The standard approach is to display a Facebook feed by pulling in links to pictures and content straight from Facebook. This means that not only are all of the pictures often much larger than they should be, but on every single page load, your user has to make http requests to multiple domains and download all of the content from your Facebook feed, on EVERY page load. 

= Typical Facebook Feed Plugins can double page loads in some instances! =

As a web consultant for hundreds of sites, I found myself constantly having to tell my client "this site would have great load times and page scores...if it weren't for the social media feed". 

This plugin was built to address this issue. It finds and retrieves the optimal image sizes from facebook and then stores them to your server, creating a fully cacheable newsfeed. This keeps everything on your server, allowing users to cache the images and feed and makes your page load much faster!

= Here are some of the benefits of the Snazzy Cacheable Facebook Feed: =

*   Faster page loads mean more favorable SEO results, since Google began penalizing users for slow page loads.
*   Bounce rates are reduced, since faster load times allow more content to be consumed in less time, and gives a better user experience.
*   Caching settings are customizable. You can select the cache to expire every hour, 4 hours, day, 3 days, week or month.
*   Even when the cache does need to be refreshed, it is refreshed asynchronously via javascript, after the page loads, so your users will not notice a difference in site performance.
*   Included widget and shortcode, for easy implementation
*   Customizations for post limit and widget size, for optimal performance and experience.

I'd encourage you do run a page speed test for yourself and compare this plugin to the competition. This plugin will outperform anything on the market today.

== Installation ==
*   Install this plugin from the Wordpress Plugin directory, activate, and navigate to "Settings/Snazzy Cacheable Facebook Feed to set up the plugin.
*   Implement the feed via a widget or insert the shortcode: [sff_facebook_widget] into any post or page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does this make my entire site faster? =
It makes your facebook feed faster due to not having to fetch content from Facebook servers on every page load. However, your site may still suffer from bad coding practices that are out of my control. Test your site with a speed testing website, such as http://gtmetrix.com to find out more information.

= Nothing happens when I implement the feed =
This plugin requires the PHP basics: cURL, Apache write permissions to the plugin folder, and basic jQuery on the front end. 

= This plugin is free. There has to be a catch? =
No catch. I made this plugin out of necessity for the websites that I build and manage and I felt as if the rest of the community could use it!

= You made such an awesome plugin, you must be ruggedly handsome as well? =
Yes, we are all ruggedly handsome and consistently spend time in the outdoors wearing flannels.
